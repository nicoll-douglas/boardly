## Lessons Learnt

This was one of the first projects I constructed on a truly large scale. One of the key lessons that taught me is the benefit of keeping a codebase clean, organised and reusable. A codebase that is modular and feature-driven not only improves the developer experience in building an application, but keeps the approach user-first and allows for build-on-top development to continuously serve the needs of the user or client without breaking code that comes before you.

## Planned Features

Some features I plan to add when I have more time to work on this project and further improve the user experience:

- User notifications
- List sorting, searching and filtering
- Board admin privileges
- Friend lists and direct messages / realtime interactions
- Support for image, video and multimedia threads

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, please send me an email at dev.nicoll.douglas@gmail.com. I'm constantly looking for ways in which I can improve as a developer!
